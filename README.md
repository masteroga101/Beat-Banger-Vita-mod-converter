# Beat-Banger-Vita-mod-converter

A multi purpose tool designed for the beat banger ps vita port

## How to use

1. Move all of your RELEASE (check below if mods are legacy or demo) mods so they are all at the same file level e.g. `BBVita/Modstest/(All you downloaded mods here)`

2. Run the converter and you should be given a prompt to paste a file location into

3. You can find this location by going to your mods folder and going one layer up. In the above example you would be in the `Modstest` folder so you can see all your downloaded mods

4. Click on the bar to the left of your search bar and you should be given a file location, copy and paste this into the converter and press enter

5. Wait until the all the mods are sorted through and command prompt has vanished, then go back to where you staored your mods and they should all be set for moving onto the vita



## Legacy and demo mods

so legacy and demo mods dont run natively on beatbanger release however there are converters that allow you to convert legacy/demo mods to release.

1. Oldish beat banger builds, id recommend a february 2025 build, drag zipped legacy mods onto the screen and the game should convert them automatically and output them in your mods folder

2. a community made converter, i modified the biggest one to be less abysmally dogshit but it still isnt perfect, donwload can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RZLZBCJryJo8fACVsOVl4N_ydU61-OgJ/view?usp=drive_link)
